This is a new index.md in the docs folder in main. This is just to show segrigation of documents in a tree format.
We can create several folders for different types of documentation.
For example, we can have a new folder for every sector in secury, such as:
- Red team
- Team meeting notes
- Sprints
- Weekly Reports
- Blue team

This way we have a future proof layout and tree hierarchy that we can use to organize and store our data.
